Caffeine: A Visualized Profiler for Web Applications
************************************************************
About: Allows you to capture the run time of specific Javascript object's methods so you can see how the code YOU wrote is doing (and only that code). 

Required libraries: jQuery, d3.js


- jsProfiler.js: Logs functions' runtime and captures the call stack for breakdown and evaluation of a function's speed

- Pyrofiler (maybe coming soon): Visualized requests coming in and out of a Python (Flask) server
